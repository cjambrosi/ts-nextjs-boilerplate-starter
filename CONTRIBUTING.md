# Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to this project in several ways.

Please follow this guide when raising issues, and contributing to the **ts-nextjs-boilerplate-starter** repository.

## :lady_beetle: Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.

If you've found any problem, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an [issue](https://github.com/cjambrosi/ts-nextjs-boilerplate-starter/issues). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed as soon as possible. You can [create a new pull request](https://github.com/cjambrosi/ts-nextjs-boilerplate-starter/compare) and view [current pull requests](https://github.com/cjambrosi/ts-nextjs-boilerplate-starter/pulls).

## :sparkles: Commits
